# Problem Statement Draft 1:

Students often utilize online calendars to organize their schedules, but the current options available are either too cluttered, convoluted, or do not implement some features students would appreciate having. For example, some currently use Google Calendar to store their class schedule and due dates. However, the user interface is not designed to effectively remind students of upcoming due dates and is intended purely for use as a calendar to store scheduled events. This makes it difficult to view the information that you need in a timely manner, which is essential for students. How can we design a task-oriented calendar to address the issues facing students using the current models of digital calendar organization?

# Problem Statement Draft 2:

Students do not have a platform with an easily navigable user interface to organize their tasks, homework, and other events. For example, if a student has homework due at midnight and a basketball game at 5 pm, both of these events appear to have the same priority on most task schedulers. Prior solutions include using Google Calendar to keep track of their tasks and events, as well as when and where they are. Some difficulties in these prior solutions are that they cannot prioritize tasks, make tasks difficult to view by types (homework vs event), and have an interface that can be overwhelming and can result in a student forgetting a homework assignment. How can a task organizer prioritize tasks, make tasks easy to view by types (homework vs event), and have an interface that allows students to ensure they turn in work on time?
